# pandas-homework

### Summary
This code tackles the pandas homework by analyzing mutiple portfolios. The initial 3 datasets were provided by the instructors and the second set of 3 stocks were created by me by pulling stock closing prices from Google Sheets using the Google Finance function. All of the files are in CSV format. The first section deals with creating dataframes and cleaning the data. The second section deals with analyzing the original datasets provided using various methods. The third section deals with the aforementioned data pulled from Google Finance that is blended with the original dataset and then analyzed using the same methods in the section above. Those analyses include, but are not limited to: cumulative returns, rolling averages, betas and sharpe ratios.

### Note to Evaluator
The homework is contained in 'whale_analysis.ipynb.' If the notebook fails to load on the first attemp, clicking 'reload?' should remedy the issue. I have also retained the instructor's demo CSVs in case the evaluator wants to plug those CSVs into my code. Finally, the text formatting for the written analysis answers are a bit skewed since jupyter and git seem to display comments differently. Nonetheless, my responses are written in full sentences and are otherwise legible and comprehensible.
